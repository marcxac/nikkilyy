          There's nothing in this world that I'm more grateful for than you, you are the best blessing The Lord has ever given me, you're truly incomparable to anyone and I will love you till the end of time itself and even beyond, my love for you has no end, there wouldn't ever be a time where I would ever be tired or bored of you, you are my baby and we are soul tied forever, you're literally all I ever wanted in a girl and so much more, there's nothing I could be more thankful and happy for than having you as my dear girlfriend and being your boyfriend, we are locked in forever! 
I love you so soooo much my wife Nikki, mwah mwaahhh !!ðŸ«¶             -Marc
